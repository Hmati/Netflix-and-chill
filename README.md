Netflix Recommendation System using Python
Hereâ€™s How Netflix Recommendation System Works
The recommendation system of Netflix shows you movies and TV shows according to your interests. Netflix has a lot of data because of its user base. Its recommendation system predicts a personalised catalogue for you based on factors like:

your viewing history
the viewing history of other users with similar tastes and preferences as yours
genres, category, description, and more information about the content that you watched in the past
